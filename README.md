# Unsupervised Learning Assignment - CHEP ML898

*Purpose:* This repository was created as part of the CHEP ML898 Unsupervised learning assignment.

My experience: I found this assignment to be quite challenging, especially since I had no prior experience.  
However, it was also very rewarding to learn about new techniques in machine learning. 
I had to spend a lot of time researching and experimenting with different codes, but it was worth it in the end.
